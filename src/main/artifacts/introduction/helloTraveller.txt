Hey there you're finally awake.....

Looks like you really hurt that head of yours, let me have a look at it and see if there are any signs of infections.

Looks like it's alright.
I have some bad news for you....
The men you were with.... yeah they were all slaughtered by that beast in that mystic jungle. I am surprised that you somehow survived.
I found you lying on the path next to a tree covered in leafs
Good thing I got to you before someone or something else did. The woods here are not safe.
My horse... right, that one
*horse huffs*
Yeah he somehow found you, he was smelling you while I took a break to gather some herbs and berries. You owe your life to him not me

Oh, yeah what is your name?

:playerNameTag: huh? haven't heard that name in ages,
